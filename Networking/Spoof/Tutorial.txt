1. :  Upload the file to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all
2. :  echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
3. :  iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -p all -s "YOUR VPS IP" -j SNAT --to-source 8.8.8.8
4. :  If you have Iptables Spoof, you can not do a yum update or apt-get update. That's why you can make the spoof on the command:
sudo iptables -t nat -F and then turn it on again when you're done with installation.
5. For monitoring use "TCPDUMP" :  tcpdump -i eth0 ip -X dst host "IP from your second VPS"
NOTE: This work on all VPS servers that are not OpenVZ
